"The sphinx_rtd_theme is primarily a sass_ project that requires a few "
"other sass libraries. I'm using bower_ to manage these dependencies and "
"sass_ to build the css. The good news is I have a very nice set of grunt_"
" operations that will not only load these dependencies, but watch for "
"changes, rebuild the sphinx demo docs and build a distributable version "
"of the theme. The bad news is this means you'll need to set up your "
"environment similar to that of a front-end developer (vs. that of a "
"python developer). That means installing node and ruby."
